    <h1>Patrick Young</h1><p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle launch. from initial product conception through the actual product</p>
    <p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.</p>
